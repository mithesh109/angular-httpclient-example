# HttpclientExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

In this tutorial, we’ll take you step by step on a journey to build an example Angular application from scratch that uses many Angular APIs such as HttpClient, and Material Design.

Here are a few things we'll learn:

How to mock a REST API server that uses fake data from a JSON file
How to consume the REST API from our Angular 8 application using  Httplient
How to handle HTTP errors using the RxJS  throwError()  and  catchError()  operators
How to retry failed HTTP requests in poor network conditions and cancel pending requests using the RxJS  retry()  and  takeUntil() operators
How to create and make use of Angular components and services
How to set up routing and Angular Material in our project and create a professional-looking UI with Material Design components
And finally, we’ll learn how to deploy the application to Firebase using the  ng deploy  command available in Angular 8.3+.
You’ll also learn by example:
